🩺 Capsule Endoscopy Classification using InceptionV3
====================================================

📌 Overview
-----------
This project is a deep learning–based medical image classification system
designed to automatically detect gastrointestinal abnormalities from
capsule endoscopy images using the InceptionV3 convolutional neural network.
It assists clinicians by providing fast and reliable diagnosis support
through an easy-to-use web interface.

The system uses transfer learning, image preprocessing, and standard
evaluation metrics to ensure accurate predictions.
